# SHatomATOR

A simple script to upgrade [Atom Editor](https://atom.io) for RPM systems.

For now it only upgrades your already installed Atom Editor version.

I am planning to add other functions too. Something that is very obvious in the script as I have commented out a lot of lines.

### Roadmap

* Add install function
* Add an alias to .bashrc
